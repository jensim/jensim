### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jens.  
Pronouns: he, him

[[These]](https://jensim.github.io) are my pages.  
And [[this]](https://github.com/mega-manipulator/mega-manipulator-standalone) is my current hobby project.  
Currently, I'm hired by Qapital, to build cool tools and services in their life-/money-management app (backend).

I recently tried GoLang..  
Didn't like it that much for "serious" stuff.  
Felt like a prototyping language. Nothing I'd trust my money with.  
I was a Java dev for many years, until I discovered that there are many other (and better) languages to express and create the things we want to solve. Now I consider myself a polyglot, but that might be an overstatement ðŸ¤· I do mostly Kotlin, Rust, TypeScript, Bash & Java.

I like cats. If you don't, I might try to convert you.. ðŸ˜†  
Aside from that, if you wanna know who I am as a person/professional dev, I read an article that I felt struck near the target for me - https://wildcardpeople.com/what-is-a-wildcard-person
