### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jens.  
Pronouns: he, him

[[These]](https://jensim.github.io) are my pages.  
And [[this]](https://github.com/mega-manipulator/mega-manipulator) is what im currently working most at.  

I recently tried GoLang..
Didn't like it that much for "serious" stuff.
Felt like a prototyping language. Nothing I'd trust my money with.

I like cats. If you don't, I might try to convert you.. ðŸ˜†  
And I do not like repeating myself, in code. (  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't get me wrong some times it's the best thing in the world having the code repeat itself.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just dont want to be the one repeating it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's where search-n-replace, multi-cursor, and batch changes comes in to play.  
)
